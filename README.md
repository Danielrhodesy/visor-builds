# Visor

Visor is a live coding environment for real-time visual performance. Visor bridges the gap between creative coding and VJing by offering user interfaces to easily interact with live coded Processing sketches. Visor offers a simple API for mapping visuals to audio or MIDI controllers, all in the expressive Ruby programming language.

This repository is used to host Visor builds while the project is closed source.
